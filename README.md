# RDAP-ODF

[Verisign Labsâ€™](https://www.verisign.com/en_US/company-information/verisign-labs/) RDAP client POC based on - [OAuth 2.0 Device Flow for Browserless and Input Constrained Devices](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-device-flow-08)

## Introduction

This software demonstrates how the OAuth device flow can be used for Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) clients that have limited user interfaces, such as with a command line client. Google is used as the authorization provider for demonstration purposes.

## Build and Installation
### Setup

To support the ODF device flow, the client must first be registered with Google. Detailed registration documentation can be found at <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ForDevices>.  

##### Steps to register an RDAP ODF Client
1. Navigate to <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials/> and sign in with a gmail.com account that will manage the client credentials.
2. Select **credentials** under the **APIs & Services** menu on the left
3. Click **Create credentials** to generate new client credentials
4. Select **OAuth client Id** from the dropdown to start the *Create OAuth client ID* workflow
5. Select **Other** for Application Type
6. A **name** field appears, enter the application client name (e.g. RDAP ODF Client)
7. Click **create** to generate the credentials

A dialog will appear with the client ID and client secret for copy/pasting. Credentials are also available on the google credentials page under OAuth 2.0 client IDs. Click on the client name to view/edit the credentials for that client.

### Post client registration
After registration, the RDAP server URL and client credentials need to be registered in the RDAP ODF client.

**Alternative 1:** Update com.rdap.odf.google.clientId, com.rdap.odf.google.clientSecret, and com.rdap.odf.rdapBaseUrl properties in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.  The Client ID and Client secret can be copied from the steps above.

```
# fill in your client id and secret 
com.rdap.odf.google.clientId=${google_client_id}
com.rdap.odf.google.clientSecret=${google_client_secret}

# rdap service endpoint, e.g., https://rdap.verisignlabs.com/rdap/v1
com.rdap.odf.rdapBaseUrl=${rdap_url}
```

**or Alternative 2:** Leave the application properties as is and set google_client_id, google_client_secret, and rdap_url environment variables before running the client.
   
```
# Example Dynamic Enviroment Variable Setup in Bash on Redhat 7
export google_client_id=abc1234567
export google_client_secret=98765
export rdap_url=https://rdap.verisignlabs.com/rdap/v1
```

### Prerequisites

- `java-1.8.0-openjdk` or higher version

- `maven`

- `rpm-build`  

*Note that rpm-build is only needed if your operating system uses the RPM package management system.  For systems that do not support RPM, rpm-build is not needed and the following section should be removed from the pom.xml so that only a jar file will be produced.*
      
  ```
  <plugin>
    <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
    <artifactId>rpm-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    ....
  </plugin>
  ```

### Build

Get the source
```
git clone https://github.com/verisign/rdap-odf.git
cd rdap-odf
```

Update client based on **Post client registration** section above

Build the project
```
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

After the build is completed, target/rdap-odf-1.0.jar will be created and can be used directly. Alternatively, target/rpm/rdap-odf/RPMS/noarch/rdap-odf-1.0-1.noarch.rpm is also produced and can be installed via the package manager.

### Usage 

#### Run with jar

```
java -jar ./target/rdap-odf-1.0.jar
```
The current directory will be used as your working directory where the client data and logs are stored.

#### Install RPM
You can also choose to install the rpm, which is located at target/rpm/rdap-odf/RPMS/noarch.

Run 
```
sudo rpm -i rdap-odf-1.0-1.noarch.rpm
```

After installation, you will have /usr/local/bin/rdap-odf as the executable and /app/rdap-odf/ as the working directory for the client.

### Build and Run with Docker
Docker version 18.03.1 is used in our test.

```
docker build -t "rdap-odf-docker" .
```
```
docker run -it rdap-odf-docker
```

## Example Execution Flow

When the rdap-odf client is started for the first time it will be in an **Unauthenticated** mode. If the user has logged in before and the token data is still valid, then the client will start in an **Authenticated** mode.  A typical execution flow is shown below:
```
Unauthenticated> domain -n nic.cc
{"objectClassName":"domain", ...}

Unauthenticated> domain --type auth --name test.cc
Start oauth device flow. Getting user code...
Please visit https://www.google.com/device on your second device and authorize with code ...

Pending Authentication> client is authenticated
{"objectClassName":"domain", ...}

Authenticated> nameservers --ip 1.2.3.*
{"nameserverSearchResults":[{"objectClassName": ...}

Authenticated> domain --type unauth --name nic.cc
{"objectClassName":"domain", ...}

Authenticated> quit
```

From the above, you will notice that there are 2 types of queries: _authenticated_ and _unauthenticated_.  The default behavior is to submit queries with privilege corresponding to the client's current state; i.e. an unauthenticated query is sent in Unauthenticated mode.  If authenticated, the ODF client uses the id_token and access_token obtained from the OAuth device flow to obtain a more detailed RDAP response -- if the RDAP service supports access control using OpenID Connect.

## Commands
To view all of the commands supported by this client, type "help" in the console prompt:
```
Unauthenticated> help 
AVAILABLE COMMANDS

Built-In Commands
        clear: Clear the shell screen.
        help: Display help about available commands.
        script: Read and execute commands from a file.
        stacktrace: Display the full stacktrace of the last error.

Exit Cmd
        quit: Quit the client.

Main Commands
        auth: OAuth related functionalities, including start oauth device flow, refresh token, and drop authed state.
        show: Show client information such as status and tokens.
        test: Test batch RDAP queries in authenticated / unauthenticated mode.

Query Commands
        domain: Send a domain lookup query to an RDAP service and show response.
        domains: Send a domain search query to an RDAP service and show response.
        entities: Send an entity search query to an RDAP service and show response.
        entity: Send an entity lookup query to an RDAP service and show response.

Typing "help *command*" will provide an explanation of the options a command supports:
```
Unauthenticated> help nameservers

NAME
	nameservers - Send a nameserver search query to an RDAP service and show response.

SYNOPSYS
	nameservers [[-n] string]  [[-i] string]  [[-t] string]  [[-o] string]  [-p]

#### Syntax
*This tool uses Spring Shell, refer to that documentation to learn more: <https://docs.spring.io/spring-shell/docs/2.0.0.RELEASE/reference/htmlsingle>*

Spring Shell processes commands and arguments first by tag value then by order. For domain queries that order would be
``` 
domain [-n] string  [[-t] string]  [[-o] string]  [-p] 
```


By Spring Shell priorities, the following are all equivalent.
```
domain test.cc auth

domain --name test.cc --type auth

domain --type auth --name test.cc
```

It is recommended to use the tags with the commands in order to ensure that the command is not order specific and make it easier to catch errors.  

**Error Example:**

The following command is invalid (-type should be --type). This command will query the server with *name*=-type, *type*=auth, and *output*=test.cc and return an unpredictable result.
```
Unauthenticated> domain -type auth test.cc
{"notices":...}
```  

However, providing a command with the tag parameters results in catching the error due to no depedency on the order of parameters.
```
Unauthenticated> domain -type auth --name test.cc
Unsupported command.
```



## Batch Execution
The *script* command allows support for batch-style execution of RDAP queries.
In this mode, you must specify a single query per line, where each query supports the same format as it does when executed individually in the console.
